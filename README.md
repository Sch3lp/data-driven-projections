# data-driven-projections

Companion repository for my presentation / workshop called _"Confidence in Planning: Data Driven Projections with Kotlin Notebooks"_

## Description
Estimation sucks! Projections For The Win!

In this workshop you'll get hands-on experience making MonteCarlo simulations that actually tell your stakeholders "When it will be done" with a known accuracy.  
For example. you'll be able to tell them: "With 85% certainty we can say that the next milestone of 12 work items will be completed within the next 56 days".  
Added bonus for managers / scrummasters: your developers will love doing it, because it's all done in a Kotlin Notebook living right next to the codebase.  

I'll give you a dataset, and a starter project to start using Kotlin Notebooks (IntelliJ IDEA required).  
From there we'll do some data exploration, over to some cleaning, selection, etc. To then do MonteCarlo simulations, which will culminate in an Aging Chart and MonteCarlo graphs.
