# Confidence in Planning
## Data Driven Projections with Kotlin Notebooks
Imagine:  
You're halfway in your current milestone.  
One of the higher-ups is at your desk, asking when the next milestone can be delivered.  
Apparently, one of their important partners needs to know, so they can reserve time in their teams to integrate with our software.   
You sort of know what's expected in this next milestone, but you still haven't estimated it because you've been busy actually being productive.  
So, you tell them you'll plan an estimation meeting with the whole team next Monday.  
Next Monday one of your senior devs is ill and there's an annoying bug that the rest of the team is still working on, so you decide to just estimate it yourself, it's just a high-level estimation anyway.

Fast-Forward to the start of the next milestone.  
You're two weeks in, and the burn-down chart is already telling you that you'll be 30 days over time in delivering the milestone.  
Guess the partner will have to keep their team busy.

Those 30 days over time turn into 30 MORE days over time, which turn into 15 MORE days over time.

What if you'd been able to tell your higher-up that the team is 85% certain it would be able to deliver the next milestone by a specific date or before,  
and you wouldn't even have to do an estimation meeting with the entire team.

Sounds like a dream?
